## Introduction

Always wanted to create an immersive Instagram game effect, but not sure how to? We will show you the way! This tutorial will guide you on how to create an Augmented Reality (AR) puzzle game using the Spark AR Studio, no experience required!
It can be daunting to learn a new technology or software, especially for cutting edge technology such as AR! Fret not, we all start somewhere! For us, our journey and foray into this space only commenced during the competition period of the Facebook AR Hackathon, and if we can do it, so can you! 

### What Are We Building

We will be creating a puzzle game that we did for the Facebook AR Hackathon, called [Pirate Dash 360](https://devpost.com/software/pirate-dash-360). It is an immersive 360° AR puzzle platformer game, that hones logical thinking, memory and problem solving skills. Players guide the pirate to the treasure by swapping directional tiles. 

### Key Concepts Covered

Through this tutorial, you will learn how to:
- Utilise various features of Spark AR Studio
- Import and customize game assets using Spark AR Studio
- Augment game environment using Spark AR Studio and JavaScript
- Add animations using Spark AR Studio and JavaScript

## Before We Start
### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Javascript: https://javascript.info, https://www.json.org/json-en.html

Basic JavaScript knowledge is recommended for this tutorial as it is required for scripting of animations and setting up the scene for the game. Within JavaScript, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a data format which can be used to define the structure of the game. In Pirate Dash 360, it is used to define the tiles required for each level.

### Software Prerequisites
- Spark AR Studio v98: https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/download
- A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download 
- A version control software, such as Git or GitHub for Desktop: https://git-scm.com/downloads, https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop
